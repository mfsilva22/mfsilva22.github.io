            <div class="content-title">Educational Research Activities and Impact</div>
            <p>My research is often driven by the challenges I encounter in my teaching practice. These challenges spark my curiosity to explore how students learn, how their motivation and learning experiences can be enhanced, and how educational technologies can be developed and refined to support learning and assessments. My research interests center on A) the design and development of assessment and learning tools, B) teaching practices that foster improved sense of belonging and equity, and C) the innovation and improvement of courses through communities of practice. This focus connects practical teaching challenges with research that advances educational practices and tools.</p>

<h2 id="a-design-and-development-of-computer-based-assessments-and-learning-tools">A) Design and development of computer-based assessments and learning tools</h2>

<p>Advancing educational technology and assessment methods is central to improving learning outcomes and student engagement. The design of auto-graded computer-based assessments enables scalable and consistent evaluations, which is especially important when adopting best practice pedagogies such as <a href="/research/frequent_testing/">frequent testing and retakes</a>. Tools like <a href="/research/asag/">LLM-based automatic short answer grading</a> create opportunities for rapid feedback and additional practice for questions that are difficult to auto-grade. To make powerful platforms like PrairieLearn accessible and easy to use for all instructors, research into LLM-based algorithms is needed to <a href="/research/ai_question_generation/">generate randomized question generators</a> efficiently. Moreover, <a href="/research/testing_modalities/">understanding the security of different testing modalities</a> is critical for ensuring the integrity of assessments and building trust in the accuracy of learning measurements.</p>

<h2 id="b-teaching-practices-to-support-equity-and-enhance-sense-of-belonging">B) Teaching practices to support equity and enhance sense of belonging</h2>

<p>Creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment requires intentional teaching practices that address the diverse needs of students. For example, <a href="/research/collaborative_learning/">collaborative learning activities</a> can foster a stronger sense of belonging by encouraging peer interaction and teamwork. <a href="/research/flexible_deadline/">Flexible deadlines</a> and <a href="/research/inperson_vs_online/">online class option</a> can provide equitable opportunities for success by accommodating students’ varying circumstances without compromising academic rigor. These practices collectively aim to create a classroom environment where all students feel supported and empowered to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="c-working-with-other-faculty-to-improve-teaching-and-learning">C) Working with other faculty to improve teaching and learning</h2>

<p>I believe instructors become better educators when they collaborate within a supportive community of peers who are passionate about teaching and dedicated to finding innovative ways to enhance the classroom experience. I have collaborated with faculty from engineering and mathematics programs to redesign courses, ensuring they align more closely with current best practices in teaching.</p>
