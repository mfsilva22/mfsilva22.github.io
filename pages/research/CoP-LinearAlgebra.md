header:  Bringing computational tools to a linear algebra course
---

In Fall 2019, a team of faculty from the Mathematics, Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering Departments began working on a project to improve the curriculum of the Linear Algebra course offered to students in the College of Engineering. The goal was to make the course more accessible to sophomores by removing the Calculus III prerequisite and introducing computational tools, allowing students to solve more complex and realistic problems.

One of my contributions to this project was creating computer laboratory assignments, which were implemented as collaborative learning activities during small discussion sections. The course was first offered as a pilot experiment in Fall 2020 to 300 students. This new course, called Computational Tools for Linear Algebra, is now required for most engineering majors in the College of Engineering, with about 2,500 students enrolling each year.

To measure the impact of these changes and perform longitudinal studies, I developed a Linear Algebra Concept Inventory using the PrairieLearn system. I first offered this assessment as an optional quiz during the first week of my Numerical Methods class in Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. It was also given to students in other classes, and we now have data from over 1,000 students, ranging from freshmen to seniors. We found that students with less mathematics background who completed the new computational linear algebra course performed significantly better on quizzes in my course compared to those who took the traditional linear algebra course. The results were presented at SIGCSE 2023.
