header:  Overhaul of the mechanics course sequence
---

As I worked on the development and implementation of course improvements in the Mechanics courses, it was important to develop a community of practice (CoP) consisting of faculty who were committed to continuing these reforms and able to collaborate closely. Instructors that belonged to this CoP had weekly meetings to discuss course development, teaching assistant training and assessments tools. Within this community, I developed lecture content, collaborative learning discussion section activities and a large data set of online assessments for the Solid Mechanics and Statics courses. I have also mentored and assisted other faculty when teaching these large classes for the first time.
