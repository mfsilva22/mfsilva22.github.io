header:  Incorporating Python into the engineering curriculum
---

Based on the successfull re-design of the linear algebra course, another community of practice was formed to incorporate similar computational Python-based lessons to other courses required to many engineering programs, including Statics, Differential Equations and Control Systems. My main role was to mentor instructors teaching these courses, and interact with undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants, to support the development and implementation of the Python-based activities. These activities were supported by two internal grants.
