header: Comparison of different computer-based testing modalities
---

Computer-based testing can be administered through various modalities. In a series of studies, we investigated the following testing modalities:

- **Unproctored sync**: Exams are completed remotely, synchronously, during lecture, without any proctoring.
- **BYOD** (Bring-Your-Own-Device) **in-person sync**: Exams are completed in the classroom, synchronously, during lecture time, with staff proctoring by actively walking around the room to monitor students.
- **BYOD Zoom sync**: Exams are completed remotely with Zoom proctoring, synchronously, during lecture time. Staff proctor a Zoom meeting consisting of approximately 20-30 students.
- **CBTF** (Computer-Based Testing Facility) **sync**: Exams are completed at a secure testing center, synchronously, during lecture time. The facility includes firewall-protected computers, surveillance cameras, and trained proctors.
- **CBTF async**: Exams are completed at a secure testing center, asynchronously, over a flexible three-day window. The facility includes firewall-protected computers, surveillance cameras, and trained proctors.

We conducted randomized crossover experiments to compare pairs of testing modalities during different semesters (see the table below). For instance, in Fall 2023, we compared CBTF async versus BYOD in-person sync. 

### Impact on performance

One of our goals was to determine if certain testing modalities provided a performance advantage. In each crossover study, students were divided into two groups (A and B) and alternated between the two modalities across six quizzes in a semester. Each student completed three quizzes in one modality and three in the other. We used regression analyses to assess the impact of exam modality on performance. The results of these studies are summarized in the table below.

### Impact on test anxiety

In a follow-up study, we compared student self-reported test anxiety between two modalities: CBTF asyn BYOD in-person sync. 
We found no statistically significant differences between testing modes on  students' test anxiety.  We did replicate prior findings showing positive correlations between trait anxiety and test anxiety and inverse correlations between test anxiety and exam score. From a test anxiety perspective, our findings indicate that either a CBTF or BYOD configuration for computerized exams is an acceptable means for addressing large classes and/or a desire to permit computational elements.
