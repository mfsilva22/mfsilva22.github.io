header: Using software to enhance collaboration
---

Most of the evidence-based practices for collaborative
learning rely on the assumption of face-to-face interactions or asynchronous online activities. This research proposes to develop robust tools and pedagogies for online synchronous computer-supported collaborative
learning activities.

In Fall 2020, we added collaborative features to our open-source online assessment system [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com) to allow students to share the same assessment content and grades. We are currently adding the ability for groups to self-assign structured roles (e.g. [POGIL](https://pogil.org)), and developing a dashboard with the aim a) to help instructors track group's progress and collaborative patterns and b) to bring more awareness to the teams during the learning process.

In our first study, we investigated the trade-offs between asynchronous (student-scheduled) and
synchronous (instructor-scheduled) collaborative learning. We performed a
quasi-experimental study in two courses — Computer Architecture and Numerical Methods — to
compare the effects of asynchronous collaborative learning without structured roles to
synchronous collaborative learning with structured roles. We use a data-analytics approach to
examine how these approaches affected the student learning experience during formative
collaborative learning assessments. Teams in the synchronous offering made higher scoring
submissions (5-10% points better on average), finished assessments more efficiently (11-16
minutes faster on average), and had greater equality in the total number of submissions each
student made (for example, significant increase of 13% in the mean equality score among all
groups).
